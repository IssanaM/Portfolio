    <p>Hello! My name is Issana Momo. I am currently a freshman at Eleanor Roosevelt H igh School! I enjoy watching the sunset and late-night car drives. Some things I like to do during my free time are journaling, reading, or watching a show. Currently, my favorite TV show is Pretty Little Liars.</p>
    <p>In this portfolio, you will see the photos I've taken for Digital Media. You will see photos using various techniques that I have learned from my teacher Mr. Zeng!</p>

      <p class="text_column">&nbsp; This photography project helped me see our school in a completely different way. I was able to capture images throughout the school that I never thought had any meaning or any artistic value. I used techniques that we learned in class such as rule of thirds, leading lines, and symmetry. I did my best to really get unique moments through my photos.</p>

      <p class="text_column">This photo was taken outside of John Jay Park. We went outside to take photos using the leading lines technique. In this photo the road is leading the viewers eye&nbsp; to the building all the way in the back. The building on one side and trees on the other side also give the photo a nice visual representation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p class="text_column">&nbsp;The first sunset photo shows Manhattan and the water. I love how the sunlight reflects and the clouds add shadows. The fountain shot is from Niagara Falls on a summer trip with my best friend. The sky photo was taken upstate during a fishing trip with our familiesâ€”such a fun memory. The colorful flower bouquet stood out because it made me happy. The last photo from the Ramapo trip is simple but holds great memories and new friendships.</p>

      <p class="text_column">For my Mood Board project, I chose Ralph Lauren. The main color theme for
my project was navy blue. To complement the blue, I incorporated other colors
like green, red, and golden yellow. This would complement the blue and would
allow other products to shine as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="hero_header">The Digital Media class has taught me so much! I learned various techniques of taking photos and made wonderful memories with my peers. My favorite part of Digital Media was probably all the collages we've made! It's so fun to put all the photos that you've taken/found together and create something new!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
